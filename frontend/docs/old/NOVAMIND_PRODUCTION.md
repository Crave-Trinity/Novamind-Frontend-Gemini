# üß† NOVAMIND PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT üß†

Welcome to the production deployment guide for Novamind - the most advanced cognitive healthcare platform ever created. This guide will take you through the steps to deploy your Novamind Digital Twin application to production environments.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Make the deployment script executable if it's not already
chmod +x novamind-production-deploy.sh

# Run the deployment script with default settings
./novamind-production-deploy.sh

# Or with custom settings (environment, domain, CDN enabled, run tests)
./novamind-production-deploy.sh production novamind.health true true
```

## üìã What The Deployment Script Does

The `novamind-production-deploy.sh` script handles the entire production preparation process:

1. **Fixes TypeScript Errors** - Corrects common issues in ThemeContext and component props
2. **Optimizes Build Configuration** - Enhances Vite and TypeScript configs for production
3. **Sets Up Environment Variables** - Configures proper production settings
4. **Runs Tests** (Optional) - Validates application functionality
5. **Builds Frontend** - Creates an optimized bundle with tree-shaking and code splitting
6. **Prepares Backend** (If present) - Sets up server configurations
7. **Configures CI/CD** - Creates GitHub Actions and GitLab CI workflow files
8. **Sets Up Monitoring** - Adds health check endpoints and monitoring docs
9. **Creates Security Documentation** - Provides HIPAA-compliance checklists
10. **Generates Deployment Guide** - Produces a comprehensive deployment manual

## üîß System Requirements

- Node.js 16+ (18+ recommended)
- npm 7+
- For backend: Python 3.9+
- 2+ CPU cores and 4GB+ RAM for build process
- Production server with Nginx/Caddy and SSL certificates

## üì¶ Build Optimizations

The production build includes several optimizations:

- **Code Splitting** - Separates vendor chunks (React, Three.js) from application code
- **Tree-Shaking** - Eliminates unused code from the bundle
- **Module Preloading** - Speeds up initial load time
- **Asset Optimization** - Compresses and optimizes static assets
- **Three.js Optimizations** - Special handling for 3D brain visualization
- **CSS Optimization** - Purges unused Tailwind classes

## üîê Security Features

The production deployment includes robust security measures:

- **HIPAA-Compliant Headers** - Strict CSP and security headers
- **TLS 1.2+** - Modern SSL protocol configuration
- **PHI Protection** - Sanitization of sensitive data in logs
- **Auto-Logout** - Session timeout for inactive users
- **Audit Logging** - Tracks all data access for compliance

## üåê Deployment Options

### 1. Static Hosting (Frontend Only)

Perfect for demos or when using mock API mode:

```bash
# Build with mock API mode
./novamind-production-deploy.sh production yourdomain.com true true

# Deploy the dist directory to any static hosting:
# - Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages
# - AWS S3 + CloudFront
# - Azure Static Web Apps
```

### 2. Full-Stack Deployment

For complete production setup with backend:

1. Deploy frontend assets to web server
   ```bash
   scp -r frontend/dist/* user@server:/var/www/novamind/
   ```

2. Configure Nginx with the provided config
   ```bash
   sudo cp deployment/nginx/novamind.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/novamind.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   sudo nginx -t
   sudo service nginx reload
   ```

3. Deploy backend API (if applicable)
   ```bash
   sudo cp novamind-api.service /etc/systemd/system/
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable novamind-api
   sudo systemctl start novamind-api
   ```

## üìä Monitoring Setup

The deployment includes health check endpoints:
- Frontend: https://yourdomain.com/health.json
- API: https://api.yourdomain.com/health

### Recommended Monitoring Tools

- **Uptime Monitoring**: Pingdom, UptimeRobot
- **Application Performance**: New Relic, Datadog
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry
- **Log Management**: ELK Stack, Loki

## üìò Documentation

The deployment process generates several documentation files:

- **PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md** - Comprehensive deployment guide
- **SECURITY.md** - Security best practices and HIPAA compliance
- **MONITORING.md** - Monitoring setup and alerts

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify:

1. Open https://yourdomain.com in a browser
2. Check that the brain visualization loads correctly
3. Verify API connectivity (if applicable)
4. Test all major features
5. Run Lighthouse audit for performance
6. Validate security headers with SecurityHeaders.com

## üö® Troubleshooting

Common issues:

- **404 errors**: Check Nginx rewrite rules
- **API Connection Issues**: Verify CORS settings
- **Brain Visualization Not Rendering**: Check WebGL support
- **Slow Performance**: Verify CDN configuration
- **Missing Assets**: Check file paths in HTML source

## üíé The Novamind Difference

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed the most advanced cognitive healthcare platform in existence. The revolutionary brain visualization engine and HIPAA-compliant architecture are now ready to transform psychiatric care!
