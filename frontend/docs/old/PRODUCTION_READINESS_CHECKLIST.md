# Novamind Digital Twin: Frontend Production Readiness Checklist

This checklist ensures the Novamind Digital Twin frontend application is properly optimized for production deployment, following all architectural and performance guidelines.

## Architecture Compliance

- [ ] **Clean Architecture Separation**
  - [ ] Domain layer contains only pure business logic with no framework dependencies
  - [ ] Application layer contains services and state management
  - [ ] Presentation layer contains UI components with clear separation of concerns
  - [ ] Infrastructure layer properly encapsulates external services

- [ ] **Component Structure**
  - [ ] All components follow atomic design pattern (atoms → molecules → organisms → templates → pages)
  - [ ] Data-fetching components use container/presentation pattern
  - [ ] Each component has a single responsibility
  - [ ] Large components are code-split using React.lazy()
  - [ ] Error boundaries implemented at key points in the component tree

## Performance Optimizations

- [ ] **React Optimizations**
  - [ ] Expensive components use React.memo()
  - [ ] Event handlers use useCallback() when passed to child components
  - [ ] Complex calculations use useMemo()
  - [ ] Large lists use virtualization (react-window)
  - [ ] All list items have proper key props (no array indices)
  - [ ] Non-blocking UI updates use useTransition()
  - [ ] Proper React.Suspense boundaries are in place

- [ ] **Rendering Optimizations**
  - [ ] DOM reads and writes are batched properly
  - [ ] Animations use CSS transforms instead of top/left
  - [ ] Elements that animate use will-change CSS property
  - [ ] Off-screen content uses content-visibility: auto
  - [ ] Window resize handlers are debounced
  - [ ] Scroll event handlers are throttled

- [ ] **Three.js Optimizations**
  - [ ] Neural nodes use instancing for efficient rendering
  - [ ] Materials and geometries are shared when possible
  - [ ] All resources are properly disposed of in cleanup functions
  - [ ] WebGL shaders optimized for performance
  - [ ] Animation frame rate is limited for better performance
  - [ ] Complex geometries are pre-baked when possible

## State Management

- [ ] **Appropriate State Patterns**
  - [ ] Global state (theme, auth, preferences) uses React Context
  - [ ] UI-specific state uses useState or useReducer
  - [ ] Complex state logic uses useReducer pattern
  - [ ] State is normalized (avoiding deep nesting)
  - [ ] Forms use React Hook Form for performance
  - [ ] API data uses proper caching with invalidation

## Build & Deployment

- [ ] **Code Quality**
  - [ ] TypeScript strict checks enabled and no errors
  - [ ] ESLint passes with no warnings in production build
  - [ ] All commented-out code and TODOs addressed
  - [ ] Code splitting configured for optimal chunk sizes
  - [ ] PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces for all components

- [ ] **Bundle Optimization**
  - [ ] Tree-shaking enabled
  - [ ] Dependencies audited for size and performance
  - [ ] Code splitting configured for routes and heavy components
  - [ ] Dynamic imports used for large third-party libraries
  - [ ] Assets (images, fonts, etc.) optimized for size
  - [ ] Build analyzed for bundle size issues

- [ ] **Environment Configuration**
  - [ ] Environment variables properly set for production
  - [ ] No development features enabled in production
  - [ ] API endpoints configured for production servers
  - [ ] Feature flags properly configured
  - [ ] Error logging service configured

## Security & Compliance

- [ ] **HIPAA Compliance**
  - [ ] No PHI in URLs (using POST for sensitive data)
  - [ ] No PHI in localStorage or sessionStorage
  - [ ] Auto-logout implemented for inactive sessions
  - [ ] Form inputs validated and sanitized
  - [ ] Audit logging for all PHI access
  - [ ] Content Security Policy implemented

- [ ] **Authentication & Authorization**
  - [ ] Authentication flow properly secured
  - [ ] Sessions handled securely
  - [ ] Role-based access controls implemented
  - [ ] Protected routes properly secured
  - [ ] Token refresh mechanism in place
  - [ ] Sensitive data masked in UI

## Testing & QA

- [ ] **Test Coverage**
  - [ ] Unit tests cover critical components and logic
  - [ ] Integration tests for component interactions
  - [ ] E2E tests for critical user flows
  - [ ] Accessibility tests (axe-core) pass
  - [ ] Performance tests for critical views

- [ ] **Browser Compatibility**
  - [ ] Application tested in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
  - [ ] Mobile responsiveness tested on iOS and Android
  - [ ] Fallbacks provided for unsupported browsers

## Visualization & UX

- [ ] **Digital Twin Visualization**
  - [ ] Brain visualization renders correctly on all devices
  - [ ] Animations are smooth and performant
  - [ ] Large datasets load progressively
  - [ ] Interaction feedback is immediate
  - [ ] 3D scene adjusts to device capabilities
