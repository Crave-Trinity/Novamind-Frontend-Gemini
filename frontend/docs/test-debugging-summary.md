# Novamind Frontend Test Debugging Summary

## Fixed Issues

1. **Type Definition Conflicts**
   - Created `frontend/src/react-three-fiber.d.ts` to properly define React Three Fiber JSX elements
   - Resolved conflicts between standard DOM/SVG elements and Three.js components
   - Added explicit type definitions for Three.js components with their properties

2. **Browser API Mocking**
   - Enhanced `ThemeProvider.tsx` with defensive coding for `window.matchMedia`
   - Added checks for browser API availability before usage
   - Implemented fallbacks for different browser API versions (addEventListener vs addListener)

## Current Status

- **Atoms Directory**: ✅ All tests passing
  - ConnectionLine component tests now pass with proper type definitions
  - RegionMesh component tests now pass with the ThemeProvider fix

- **Molecules Directory**: ❌ Still has failures
  - Different types of failures than the atoms directory
  - Issues are more specific to component implementation rather than test setup

## Remaining Issues

1. **Missing DOM Elements**
   - Some tests expect elements that aren't being rendered
   - Example: `screen.getByTestId("treatment-canvas")` in TreatmentResponseVisualizer

2. **Event Handler Testing**
   - Event handlers not being called as expected in tests
   - Example: `expect(onTreatmentSelect).toHaveBeenCalled()` failing

3. **Component Import Errors**
   - Some components not being properly imported or exported
   - Error: `Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined.`

4. **Performance/Hanging Issues**
   - Full test suite (`src/presentation`) still hangs
   - Need to run tests in smaller batches to avoid memory issues

## Recommendations

1. **Incremental Testing Approach**
   - Continue testing in small batches (individual directories or even files)
   - Use `npm run test -- src/path/to/specific/component.test.tsx` for targeted testing

2. **Component-Specific Fixes**
   - Address missing testids in components
   - Ensure event handlers are properly triggered in tests
   - Fix component import/export issues

3. **Test Mocking Enhancements**
   - Review and enhance mocks for complex components
   - Consider creating more specific mocks for Three.js objects used in molecules

4. **Test Isolation**
   - Ensure tests are properly isolated and don't affect each other
   - Use `beforeEach` to reset state between tests

5. **Memory Management**
   - Consider adding explicit cleanup in tests for Three.js objects
   - Dispose of geometries, materials, and textures after tests

## Next Steps

1. Fix component-specific issues in the molecules directory
2. Address import/export issues in components
3. Once molecules tests pass, move on to organisms and other directories
4. Finally attempt running the full test suite with increased memory limits

## Technical Details

### Type Definition Solution

The key to fixing the type conflicts was creating a proper type definition file that:
1. Extends the global JSX namespace to include R3F elements
2. Explicitly defines properties for Three.js components
3. Adds missing properties to Three.js types (like `dashOffset` for LineDashedMaterial)

### Browser API Mocking Solution

For browser APIs in test environments:
1. Always check if the API exists before using it
2. Provide fallbacks for different versions of APIs
3. Use try/catch blocks to handle potential errors
4. Return empty cleanup functions when APIs aren't available
