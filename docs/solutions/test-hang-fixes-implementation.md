# Novamind Test Hang Investigation and Resolution

## Summary of Issues Fixed

We've identified and addressed several critical issues causing test hangs in the Novamind frontend test suite:

1. **Invalid Hook Calls**: React hooks were being called directly in test modules rather than being properly rendered through `renderHook`
2. **Missing Service Implementations**: The clinicalService had unimplemented but required methods
3. **Mocking Structure Issues**: Inconsistent mocking patterns with both `__mocks__` and `mocks` directories
4. **Three.js Mock Issues**: Inefficient structure for complex Three.js component mocking

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Centralized Mocking Strategy

We've consolidated all mocks into a single unified structure:

```
frontend/src/test/mocks/
├── clinical-service.mock.ts
├── index.ts
├── mock-setup.ts
└── three/
    └── index.ts
```

This provides a clean, consistent approach to mocking with:
- Individual mock files for services and external libraries
- An index.ts that exports all mocks for easy importing
- A mock-setup.ts that provides a central registration function

### 2. Proper React Hook Testing

We've implemented a pattern for testing hooks that prevents test hangs:

```typescript
// Use renderHook with a wrapper that provides all required contexts
const wrapper = createThemeWrapper();
const { result } = renderHook(() => useClinicalContext(), { wrapper });

// Wait for initial queries to settle
await waitFor(() => {
  expect(result.current.isLoading).toBe(false);
});
```

This ensures:
- Hooks are only called within React's lifecycle
- All required contexts (QueryClient, Router, Theme) are provided
- Asynchronous operations can complete properly

### 3. Service Implementation Mocks

We've created mock implementations for all service methods used by hooks, particularly:

```typescript
// Create the mock service with all required functions
export const mockClinicalService = {
  fetchSymptomMappings: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(success(mockSymptomMappings)),
  fetchDiagnosisMappings: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(success(mockDiagnosisMappings)),
  fetchTreatmentMappings: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(success(mockTreatmentMappings)),
  fetchRiskAssessment: vi.fn().mockImplementation((patientId) => {...}),
  fetchTreatmentPredictions: vi.fn().mockImplementation((patientId) => {...}),
  submitBiometricAlert: vi.fn().mockImplementation((alert) => {...})
};
```

Key improvements:
- All methods are implemented and mock-ready
- No artificial timeouts that can cause test hangs
- Proper error handling for invalid inputs
- Type-safe implementations

### 4. Three.js Mocking Improvement

We've enhanced the Three.js mocking system to properly handle:
- All required Three.js component implementations
- Clean interface pattern with proper TypeScript typing
- Canvas and WebGL context mocking
- Simplified test environment for 3D visualization

## Key Developer Guidelines

When writing tests that involve React hooks or complex API services:

1. **Never call hooks directly** in test files - always use `renderHook()` with appropriate context providers
2. **Always implement mock services** for all methods used by the hook/component
3. **Avoid timeouts or delays** in test mocks - use immediate Promise resolution
4. **Properly type all mocks** to match the real implementations
5. **Use async/await with waitFor()** to ensure asynchronous operations complete

## Future Improvements

1. Implement comprehensive test helper utilities for different component types:
   - `renderComponentWithThreeContext` for 3D visualization components
   - `renderApiComponentWithMocks` for data-fetching components

2. Create test templates for common test patterns

3. Expand mock implementations for additional services

4. Add test timing instrumentation to identify slow tests

This restructuring should resolve the test hang issues while providing a more reliable and maintainable testing infrastructure overall.
