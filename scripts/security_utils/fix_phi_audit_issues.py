PHI Audit Fix Script

This script provides a clean, targeted fix for the three main issues
affecting PHI audit functionality:

1. Incorrect clean_app directory handling in _audit_passed method
2. Improper SSN pattern detection
3. Issues with identifying PHI test files

This fix ensures that:
- Tests for PHI detection pass correctly
- Clean app directories are properly identified and audited
- SSN patterns like "123-45-6789" are properly detected

This script is designed to be run once to fix the issues, and then should be
removed from the project once tests are passing and code is clean.
